# The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
# Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

# Here's the deal:

# It must start with a hashtag (#).
# All words must have their first letter capitalized.
# If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
# If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.

# Examples

# " Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
# "    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
# ""                                        =>  false

def generate_hashtag(s):
    done = s.title() # title case, first letter uppercase
    print("This is done:", done)
    s_list = done.split(' ')
    print("And this is s_list:", s_list)
    if len(done) >= 140 or len(done) == 0:
        return False
    else:
        return '#' + ''.join(s_list)
