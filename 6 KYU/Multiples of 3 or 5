# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

# Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

# Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

    l = list(range(1, number))
    return sum([i for i in l if i%3==0 or i%5==0])

    # new_l = []

    # l = list(range(1, number))
    # for i in l:

    #         counter += i
    # return counter
